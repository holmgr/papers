# Changelog since seminar feedback

Note that my handin for the seminar was rather limited in size which in turn limited the feedback to the parts which were actually fleshed out.

## Introduction
After the feedback I made some changes to make the research question or hypothesis more clearly stated, specifically I added a paragraph explicitly explaining what the paper tries to find.
Also I added some explaination as to why the chosen patterns were of interest, i.e which langauge features I thought would have an impact on the usefulness or implementation of those patterns.

## Information Quality/Evidence
After some feedback of specific statements in the introduction I added additional sources, trying to back up claims of a factual nature.
There are however some initial statement for which there could be argued that sources are needed, however I feel that they are more angled as though provocting statements to catch interest, similar to many other papers I have seen (which also forgoes references for similar statements).

## Organization
At the last handin I filled out some early section titles to get feedback on the overall organsization. 
The only feedback that I really got was that I had some empty section which has since been rectified, and that the hypothesis should be reasoned which I think I have fulfilled with the last few parts of the introduction.

## Language and form
The feedback here were minor nitpicks on some small grammar och typos which hopefully has been fixed :).

## Analysis
No feedback was given as this part of the report was not written at the time of the seminar.
